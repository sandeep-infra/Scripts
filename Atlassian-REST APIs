  --url 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/TEST-123' \
  --user 'your-email@example.com:your_api_token' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json'
 
Step 1. Set the Method and URL
 
In Postman, choose GET.
 
Paste this into the URL field:

Step 2. Authentication
 
That --user email:apitoken means Basic Auth.
 
In Postman:

Password = your Atlassian API token
--- 
Step 3. Headers
